This is the code for the NeurIPS memARI workshop 2022 paper "Using Hippocampal Replay to Consolidate Experiences in Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Learning".

A hand-crafted Goal-Directed Intrinsic Reward was added in a later paper (see https://github.com/tanchongmin/GDIR)

Self-supervised Goal-Directed Intrinsic Reward without any handcrafting was done in a later paper (see https://github.com/tanchongmin/learning-fast-and-slow)
